**DeFi Stablecoins** â€“ A minimal, overcollateralized, algorithmically-stable cryptocurrency system inspired by MakerDAOâ€™s DSS, pegged 1:1 to the USD, and backed exclusively by exogenous collateral (WETH & WBTC). Designed without governance or fees, the system ensures stability and decentralization through collateral-backed minting and redemption.

## Features

- **Exogenous Collateral** â€“ Supports ETH & BTC as backing assets
- **USD Peg** â€“ Maintains 1 DSC = $1 peg at all times
- **Algorithmic Stability** â€“ No centralized price control
- **Overcollateralization** â€“ Ensures safety of peg
- **Minimal Governance** â€“ No fees, no complex DAO structure
- **ERC20 Stablecoin Contract** â€“ Fully compatible with DeFi protocols
